     * Implementations should be as quick as possible (for example using
     * lazy initialization of state) since the time spent in this function
     * directly impacts the performance of starting the first activity,
     * service, or receiver in a process.
     *

     * If you override this method, be sure to call `super.onCreate()`.
     *

     * Be aware that direct boot may also affect callback order on
     * Android [android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES.N] and later devices.
     * Until the user unlocks the device, only direct boot aware components are
     * allowed to run. You should consider that all direct boot unaware
     * components, including such [android.content.ContentProvider], are
     * disabled until user unlock happens, especially when component callback
     * order matters.
